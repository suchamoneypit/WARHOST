# Decisions

Durable choices for this repository. Dates are the commit date or the day the decision was recorded.

## 2026-10-09 — Wrap Eugen's image

**Decision:** `entrypoint-unraid.sh` writes settings and execs `/server/entrypoint2.sh`. This repo does not copy Eugen's server launch arguments.

**Rationale:** Game updates should come from `eugensystems/warno`. The wrapper only supplies the Unraid form. Recorded in commit `b8466df`.

## 2026-10-09 — Host networking

**Decision:** The template uses `<Network>host</Network>` and does not publish a Docker port. Operators forward `EXPOSEDPORT` as TCP and UDP. The default port is `10400`.

**Rationale:** Eugen recommends host networking and requires both protocols. Unraid host networking does not show a port mapping. `10400` is this template's default, not a port named by Eugen.

## 2026-10-09 — Form-written settings

**Decision:** `WRITE_CONFIG` defaults to true and rewrites `login.ini`, `variables.ini`, and `params_for_ai.json` on each start. Set it false only for hand-edited files.

**Rationale:** The Unraid form is the supported way to configure a server. Hand edits would otherwise be mistaken for the source of truth. Recorded in commit `b8466df`.

## 2026-10-09 — Keys stay out of git

**Decision:** Dedicated keys belong in the Unraid container settings on the server. `.gitignore` ignores `login.ini` and `/settings/`. Samples keep placeholders.

**Rationale:** A key committed once remains in git history after deletion. `EUGEN_DEDICATED_KEY` is masked in the template.

## 2026-10-09 — One container per server

**Decision:** Each server is its own container, with its own name, game port, and settings folder. Additional servers may reuse the same login and key.

**Rationale:** Eugen allows a maximum of five servers for one login and key pair. Unraid reinstall replaces the existing container, so a second server is a new container.

## 2026-10-09 — Rebuild when Eugen publishes

**Decision:** `.github/workflows/rebuild-image.yml` publishes `ghcr.io/suchamoneypit/warno-unraid:latest` when the Eugen manifest digest changes, or when the wrapper build inputs change on `main`.

**Rationale:** Players on a new WARNO patch need a rebuilt dedicated server. A normal game patch should not require an edit to this repo.

## 2026-10-09 — Jungle Law preset, RCON unset

**Decision:** The published defaults are 2v2 Conquest for workshop item `3811913066`, with Map `RDPort_JungleLaw_2v2_CONQ`. A base-game scenario ID is valid when Workshop Mod List is cleared. RCON is not on the form.

**Rationale:** The first template commit (`6ee0739`) left RCON out. The Map default was empty until the scenario IDs from the Red Dragon mod files were recorded.

## 2026-10-09 — Agent guidance and checks

**Decision:** Always-on project rules live in `.cursor/rules/`. Specialist reviewers live in `.cursor/agents/`. Durable notes live in `docs/`. `scripts/check_repo.sh` checks XML well-formedness and local repository invariants.

**Rationale:** Template review, upstream research, and independent verification are different jobs. A parsed XML file still needs an Unraid install test before it can be treated as working.
